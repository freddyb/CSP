This code relies on the existence of MANIFEST files to list the tests within
a directory.  These files consist of LF-separated lines, each of which falls
in one of categories:

* Directory: "dir foo"
* Support files: "support foo.html"
* Reftests: "foo.html == foo-ref.html == foo-ref2.html != foo-notref.html"
* Automated tests (testharness.js): "foo.html"
* Manual tests: "manual foo.html"
* HTML parser data files: "parser foo.dat"
